A fast, concurrent downloader for the Have I Been Pwned password hash database.
Converts the HIBP API responses directly into a compact binary format using
truncated 64-bit SHA1 hashes (sha1t64).

* Features

- Concurrent downloads with configurable worker count
- Direct conversion to compact binary format (no intermediate files)
- Resume support for interrupted downloads
- Progress bar with ETA
- Exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures

* Installation

#+begin_src sh
cargo install --path .
#+end_src


* Usage

Download the full dataset:

#+begin_src sh
hibp-downloader --output ./hibp-data
#+end_src

With more concurrent workers (default is 64):

#+begin_src sh
hibp-downloader --output ./hibp-data --concurrent-workers 128
#+end_src

Resume an interrupted download:

#+begin_src sh
hibp-downloader --output ./hibp-data --resume
#+end_src

Force overwrite existing data:

#+begin_src sh
hibp-downloader --output ./hibp-data --force
#+end_src

** Options

| Flag                     | Description                                         |
|--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| ~-o, --output~             | Output directory for binary files (required)        |
| ~-j, --concurrent-workers~ | Number of concurrent download workers (default: 64) |
| ~--resume~                 | Skip existing files and continue downloading        |
| ~--force~                  | Remove existing output directory before starting    |
| ~--limit~                  | Maximum prefix index to download (for testing)      |
| ~--no-progress~            | Disable progress bar                                |

* Binary Format

The downloader produces 1,048,576 files (one per 5-character hex prefix), each
containing sorted 8-byte records. This format is based on the sha1t64 approach
from [[https://github.com/oschonrock/hibp][oschonrock/hibp]].

** Why sha1t64?

The HIBP dataset contains approximately 900 million SHA1 password hashes. Storing
the full 20-byte hash for each entry requires significant space. By truncating to
64 bits, we reduce storage by over 4x while maintaining an acceptably low
collision probability.

With ~900 million entries, the probability of at least one collision is
approximately 1 in 10 billion. For password breach checking, a false positive
(incorrectly marking a password as breached) is harmless in practice.

** File Layout

Each prefix file (e.g., =00000.bin=, =FFFFF.bin=) contains:

- Fixed 8-byte records
- Sorted in ascending order
- Direct indexing: record N is at byte offset N * 8

This enables O(log n) binary search with no parsing overhead.

** Storage Comparison

| Format               | Size  | Notes                          |
|----------------------+-------+--------------------------------|
| HIBP Text (original) | 77 GB | SHA1:count per line            |
| sha1t64 binary       | 17 GB | 8 bytes per hash               |

* Design

** Concurrency Model

The downloader divides the 1,048,576 prefixes evenly among N worker tasks. Each worker:

1. Fetches a prefix range from =api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{PREFIX}=
2. Parses the response and converts each line to sha1t64
3. Writes the sorted binary file to disk
4. Updates the shared progress counter

Workers share a connection pool sized to match the worker count, maximizing HTTP connection reuse.

** Retry Logic

Failed requests are retried up to 10 times with exponential backoff starting at 100ms. This handles transient network issues and API rate limiting gracefully.

** Zero-Allocation Conversion

The hot path for converting API responses to binary avoids heap allocations:

- Prefix-to-hex conversion uses a stack-allocated 5-byte array
- Line-to-sha1t64 conversion writes directly to an 8-byte output buffer
- Hex-to-nibble conversion is a simple match expression

* Performance

Download speed depends primarily on network bandwidth and API rate limits.
With 64 concurrent workers on a fast connection, expect:

- ~1,000-2,000 prefixes per second
- Full download in 10-20 minutes

The conversion overhead is negligible compared to network latency.
